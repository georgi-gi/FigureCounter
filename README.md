# FigureCounter

FigureCounter is a simple console application, which counts the number of figures inside a 2D matrix.  
By definition, a figure is whatever a sequence of neighbouring matrix elements. Two elements are neighbours if they have a common "wall".  
For example, the following matrix  

1 0 0 0 0  
1 0 1 1 0  
0 1 0 1 0  
0 1 1 1 0  
0 0 0 0 1  
  
has three figures inside.
